## Hi, I'm 21Saliji! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

Iâ€™m a software developer (graduate from WeThinkCode_, 2025), a member of Africa's Blockchain Club and a voluntary secretary at SAYes. Iâ€™m deeply passionate about how data, blockchain, and ethical technology can reshape industries and communities.

With experience in Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Solidity, I love building solutions that are both meaningful and technically sound. Whether Iâ€™m collaborating on blockchain projects or any other project or volunteering, Iâ€™m always driven by purpose and possibility.

As we love to mention ~ May the code be with you!
